#summary A small utility to start programs as a daemon

= Introduction =

kshell is a simple utility to run a program as a daemon.
Inspired after the KDE core utility of the same name, this program is a way of using the [http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man3/daemon.3.html daemon(3)] function call easily from the shell. Although the daemon(3) syscall provides for changing the working directory to the filesystem root, /, we do not do that. 

Similarly to it's KDE counterpart, kshell is meant to launch GUI programs from the shell in a better manner than just backgrounding them with &.

kshell is highly portable, and will run on nearly any Unix-like operating system that provides the daemon(3) library call in it's libc.
