= Introduction =

`keygrab` is a simple command-line based CD-Key grabber for !StarCraft and !StarCraft: Brood War. It will work with any version of !StarCraft starting with 1.15.1 and higher.

= Details =

To use `keygrab`, you will need to run it from the Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`). Provide the `-v` switch followed by a version number.

The following version numbers are accepted:

  * `1.15.1`
  * `1.15.2`
  * `1.15.2-alt` -- Use this if the normal 1.15.2 setting does not work for you.
  * `1.15.3`
  * `1.16.0`
  * `1.16.1`

`keygrab` should be invoked from the commandline like so:

`keygrab -v 1.16.1`

However, if you do not specify your !StarCraft version with `-v`, 1.16.1 will be assumed, and you can just invoke `keygrab` simply as:

`keygrab`

You will need a working Internet connection to use `keygrab`. `keygrab` itself does not use the Internet, instead, you will need to connect !StarCraft to Battle.net. Once you are at the Battle.net login screen, switch programs via Alt+Tab to the Command Prompt and run `keygrab`. 

If all is well, you will be presented with CD-Key used to install your copy of !StarCraft. This is exceptionally useful in the case that your CD jewel case is somehow destroyed - in this case, I *_highly_* recommend registering your CD-Key with a Battle.net 2.0 account through the Battle.net website. This has the advantage of giving you !StarCraft: Brood War for free if you don't already have the expansion :)
