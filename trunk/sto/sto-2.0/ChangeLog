Version 2.0
	* Modified the archive format. It is incompatable with 1.x 'sto'.
	* Modified the extractor to check for archive versions. Legacy
	  archives are still supported.
	* Symbolic link support was added, and backported to 1.x for 1.0.2.
	  sto-1.0.2 archives that contain symbolic links are properly extrated
	  using the legacy extraction algorithim.
	* Directory support (very buggy)

Version 1.0.1
	* Added `install' target to Makefile
	* Added manpage
	* Changed build.minix for new Makefile target.
