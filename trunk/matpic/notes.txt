Some things i noted about the instruction set of 14bit PICs, which i have not seen described anywere:

The type of arguments can be seen from the 2 most significant bytes usually:
	If they are 01 there is a bit and a byte argument.
	If they are 11 the argument is an 8bit literal.
	If they are 10 the argument is an 11bit literal.

If they are 00 it gets a little more comlicated:
	If the 3 most significant bits of the 3th nibble are 0:
		bit 7 == 1: file register argument
		bit 7 == 0: no argument
	Otherwise (opcode & 0x0E00 != 0), there is a file and destination argument.

Note to self: try clrf with bit 7 == 0 and see if it clears w too.
