this is about C version of matpic_as, lua file is older test implementation
there ought to be an interface implemented that handles combining matpic_as and preprocessor etc

to build, either copy Makefile.watcom to Makefile and run "wmake" if you are using openwatcom
or on linux/unix copy or link Makefile.nix to Makefile and run "make"
synopsis
	matpic [-d|p|P|t]
	cat <infile> | matpic [-d|p|P|t] > <outfile>
options
	-d	disassemble
  	-p	only preprocess
	-P	don't preprocess
	-t	after assembling instead of giving ihex output, disassemble again
input file is read from stdin, output written to stdout
+ - * / % & | ^ << >> ~ behave as in C, but strictly left to right
! is also supported as alias to ~ bitwise not operator
$ is the address at start of line
identifiers can be described by regex as /[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9]*/
lines are divided as follows:
	[<label>] [<instruction> [<argument>, <...>]]
if an identifier is neither a directive or instruction and present before any whitespace, it's considered a label
if an identifier is followed by a (and before any instruction/directive) ':' it's considered a label
if an identifier starts with a '.' it's considered a local label (they don't work yet tho as of this writing)
following directives exist:
	org <origin>: set origin
	data <value>, <value>: put stray words into bytecode
	file "<filename>": tell assembler what file it is working on (also sets next line # to 1)
		filenames with double quotes or newlines and stuff in them are not support (no escape codes)
	line <line #>: tell assembler what the next line is numbered
integer notation supports the following prefixes:
	none at all: decimal
	0d: decimal
	0x: hexadecimal
	0b: binary
	0o: octal
	0: octal
underscores within integers are ignored (but not in prefix plz)
utf-8 in labels / macro names etc are allowed
