this is about C version of matpic_as, lua file is older test implementation
there ought to be an interface implemented that handles combining matpic_as and preprocessor etc
+ - * / % & | ^ << >> ~ behave as in C, but strictly left to right
! is also supported as alias to ~ bitwise not operator
$ is the address at start of line
identifiers can be described by regex as /[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9]*/
an identifier at start of line, before any space is considered a label
if one happens to be behind whitespace, it is an instruction or directive
following directives exist:
	org <origin>: set origin
	data <value>, <value>: put stray words into bytecode
	file "<filename>": tell assembler what file it is working on (also sets next line # to 1)
	  filenames with double quotes or newlines and stuff in them are not support (no escape codes)
	line <line #>: tell assembler what the next line is numbered
integer notation supports the following prefixes:
	none at all: decimal
	0d: decimal
	0x: hexadecimal
	0b: binary
	0o: octal
	0: octal
underscores within integers are ignored (but not in prefix plz)
