0.0.49:
	introduced changelog
	new windows map under window list or window currently being dragged
	button_current now uses a value of "None" instead of the root window to define there is no current button
	client_focus checks if window is really viewable before setting input focus
	window list puts off screen windows on screen if they are chosen - with new client_save() function
	renamed handle_button_event() to button_handle_event()
	fixed bug in get_mwm_hints() that made it possible in weird conditions a call to XFree would be apropriate but not done, and it now passes mwmhints variable directly to XGetWindowProperty()
	on exit clients are deparented in reverse order, as this has some advantages over the old method
	removed useless get_wm_transient_for()
	fixed wlist_end() segfaulting if current == NULL

0.0.50:
	fixed bug that would sometimes draw a little square in the topleft corner of the root window
	added support for motif move hint and motif resize hint schould be fixed too
	attempted to make enum statements in matwm.h more readable
	stacking now keeps the stacking order of clients, clients keeps them from oldest to newest - and client_number() lets you specify one of those to dig trough
	introduced "layer" member in client structure, wich defines the layer of the window (always on top, always on bottom etc)
	partial EWMH implementation
	if the CAN_MOVE or CAN_RESIZE bits are not set for a client, accordingly the buttons for that will no longer be grabbed

0.0.51:
	updated changelog @ 0.0.49 to state changelog was introduced then, and @ 0.0.50 the forgotten button grab stuff was added
	renamed CHANGELOG to ChangeLog to comply with what is appearantly tradition
	now maximise function takes ewmh_strut into account
	xo and yo members now save the offset of the window when it's mapped, so it can be (hopefully) restored propperly later on
	maximise and expand now check for CAN_MOVE and CAN_RESIZE bit
	implemented a bit more EWMH things
	maximise raises client given to it, not current
	all macros are replaced by functions to give the window's size and position wich are now rather dynamically calculated then stored
	changes in client size or position are now applied by calling client_update(), client_update_pos(), client_update_size() and client_update_title() functions
	added fullscreen state
	moved code around a bit creating a little more order
	removed comment that didn't make sence anymore
	no more warp to spawned windows, this fucks up some apps (xine)
	further EWMH implementation
	changed drag function to work with EWMH stuffs, also made it restore the client if it iconic
	fixed iconify_all function that broke when stacking and clients variables were separated

0.0.52:
	button_current initialized as None (how could i forget that)
	focus new windows on creation - expirimental, maybe schould be done only if none is focussed yet or click to focus is implemented
	focussing of topmost window after client dissapear fixed - look in stacking, not clients
	title is drawn to a pixmap that is the background for the title window, as this seems to redrawed way faster
	let X draw the border now, as this also redraws faster
	beause of changes makeing motif hints property notify response be broken, it was removed - i doubt any application uses it anyway so it is not worth the effort for now
