0.0.49:
	introduced changelog
	new windows map under window list or window currently being dragged
	button_current now uses a value of "None" instead of the root window to define there is no current button
	client_focus checks if window is really viewable before setting input focus
	window list puts off screen windows on screen if they are chosen - with new client_save() function
	renamed handle_button_event() to button_handle_event()
	fixed bug in get_mwm_hints() that made it possible in weird conditions a call to XFree would be apropriate but not done, and it now passes mwmhints variable directly to XGetWindowProperty()
	on exit clients are deparented in reverse order, as this has some advantages over the old method
	removed useless get_wm_transient_for()
	fixed wlist_end() segfaulting if current == NULL

0.0.50:
	fixed bug that would sometimes draw a little square in the topleft corner of the root window
	added support for motif move hint and motif resize hint schould be fixed too
	attempted to make enum statements in matwm.h more readable
	stacking now keeps the stacking order of clients, clients keeps them from oldest to newest - and client_number() lets you specify one of those to dig trough
	introduced "layer" member in client structure, wich defines the layer of the window (always on top, always on bottom etc)
	partial EWMH implementation
	if the CAN_MOVE or CAN_RESIZE bits are not set for a client, accordingly the buttons for that will no longer be grabbed

0.0.51:
	updated changelog @ 0.0.49 to state changelog was introduced then, and @ 0.0.50 the forgotten button grab stuff was added
	renamed CHANGELOG to ChangeLog to comply with what is appearantly tradition
	now maximise function takes ewmh_strut into account
	xo and yo members now save the offset of the window when it's mapped, so it can be (hopefully) restored propperly later on
	maximise and expand now check for CAN_MOVE and CAN_RESIZE bit
	implemented a bit more EWMH things
	maximise raises client given to it, not current
	all macros are replaced by functions to give the window's size and position wich are now rather dynamically calculated then stored
	changes in client size or position are now applied by calling client_update(), client_update_pos(), client_update_size() and client_update_title() functions
	added fullscreen state
	moved code around a bit creating a little more order
	removed comment that didn't make sence anymore
	no more warp to spawned windows, this fucks up some apps (xine)
	further EWMH implementation
	changed drag function to work with EWMH stuffs, also made it restore the client if it iconic
	fixed iconify_all function that broke when stacking and clients variables were separated

0.0.52:
	button_current initialized as None (how could i forget that)
	focus new windows on creation - expirimental, maybe schould be done only if none is focussed yet or click to focus is implemented
	focussing of topmost window after client dissapear fixed - look in stacking, not clients
	title is drawn to a pixmap that is the background for the title window, as this seems to redrawed way faster
	let X draw the border now, as this also redraws faster
	beause of changes makeing motif hints property notify response be broken, it was removed - i doubt any application uses it anyway so it is not worth the effort for now

0.0.53:
	fixed the very annoying bug in mouse warping introduced with previous version
	removed now obsolete references to client_draw_border()
	introduced functions for calculating the internal size of clients, wich makes stuff a little easyer with the border being around the window insit of in it now
	fixed window snapping - it did not yet use client_x() and client_y() to get window positions, wich obviously fucked up with expanded/maximised/fullscreened windows etc
	maximise, expand and fullscreen only work if CAN_MOVE and CAN_RESIZE are set for the client, like they schould (used to work as long as one of them was set)
	CAN_RESIZE will be removed from flags if maximum size and minimum size are equal

0.0.54:
	handling configurerequests no longer uses client_move() and client_resize(), but sets the coördinates and calls client_update() - so it does not reset state etc, the first 2 functions named are to be called if the user initiated the movement
	removed iconify on _NET_WM_SET_ACTIVE for current window - it is stupid and taskbar knows better apearantly
	removed focus on map, turns out to be annoying
	client_deparents puts windows where the new client_x() and client_y() functions say it is
	free title pixmap on client_remove() - how could i forget that

0.0.55:
	fixed bug that made clients with the title "" have fucked up titlebars
	fixed bug in updating the size of titles (buttons_update() was done after call to title_width(), had to be before it)
	only update ewmh state when nececarry @ move/resize
	same for client list
	taskbar and desktop no longer show up in task list, thanks to the new DONT_LIST flag
	fullscreen bit now set for desktop
	fullscreen windows resized on resolution change
	repairered ewmh strutting thing (confused top and right)
	_NET_DESKTOP_GEOMETRY now updated on root window resize

0.0.56:
	set wlist_with to initial value from wlist_update() instead of wlist_start (this makes way more sence i think)
	weird window list behaviour introduced with 0.0.55 fixed

0.0.57:
	virtual desktops
	_NET_REQUEST_FRAME_EXTENTS and _NET_FRAME_EXTENTS, hopefully handled and set in the right way

0.0.58:
	topleft, topright, bottomleft and bottomright key bindings now also contrain to the ewmh workspace
	removed things from todo list that were already done in previous releases
	introduced key action to make windows sticky
	_NET_WM_DESKTOP messages to root window understood, so pager can move windows to other desktops etc
	removed more dumb things from TODO
	XFreePixmap() in client_remove() now right under freeing name, for clarity
	clients_alloc() no longer fails on linusk if there are no clients left
	on exit clients are now reparented in better order (current desktop and sticky windows on top, under it all desktops from left to right order, then iconic windows)
	set input focus to root window on exit - this prevents some problems with clients that steal focus i hope

0.0.59:
	added key actions for always on top and stay below, also made them listen the apropiate ewmh hints
	get_ewmh_hints() now looks on wich desktop windows schould be
	several changes/additions here and there to make the above two possible
	ewmh_update_desktop() uses long for storing the data, as i think this is more correct

0.0.60:
	drag modes defined in enum statement
	set input focus to PointerRoot on exit, not root
	GrabModeAsync for keyboard, on mouse grabbing
	cleaned up the mess in events.c a bit

	renamed end() to quit(), schould now compile and run on dragonflybsd too
	set value of _NET_WM_ACTIVE_WINDOW to None if current == NULL, as specified by EWMH

	do not try to unfocus removed clients
	always show window id in debugging messages

0.0.62:
	update window list when clients iconified/restored/restacked

0.0.63:
	obey global configuration file /etc/matwmrc
	separate bits for horizontal and vertical maximalisation
	replaced client_maximise() and client_fullscreen() by client_toggle_state()
	ewmh maximise message can now do separate horizontal and vertical maximalisation
	added default key bindings for hoizontal and vertical maximise (using new h/v argument to maximise key action)
	intendation now done with tabs instead of spaces
	all horizontal/vertical stuff now also works for expand, and for both now l, r, t and b argument can be used to apply these actions in one of these directions

0.0.64:
	ewmh state only set to maximized if maximised to both directions
	replaced t and b arguments for maximise and expand with u and d (up and down)
