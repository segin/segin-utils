matwm2 is a simple window manager for X11. It features window frames with titlebar and buttons, configurable key bindings and mouse buttons, support for EWMH and motif hints, focus-follows-mouse and click-to-focus focus models and virtual desktops.
It is written and maintained by Mattis Michel <sic_zer0@hotmail.com>, and distributed under the MIT licence (see: LICENCE file).

To compile and install, review the first block of text in the Makefile to specify the right folders to look for headers and libraries in and install to.
If you want to define any extra flags for compiling (like debugging symbols) look at the second paragraph in the Makefile.
After that run "make" and "make install" - if all goes well it schould then be compiled and installed.

To launch matwm2 when starting X you might want to add "exec matwm2" at the end of your $HOME/.xinitrc or (if you use xdm) $HOME/.xsession file, if matwm2 schouldn't be the magic process you can use "matwm2&" in one of these files.
Before usage and for further information, please consult the manual page (run "man matwm2" on a terminal, after it has been installed).
