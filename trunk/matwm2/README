INTRODUCTION
  matwm2 is a simple window manager for X11.
  It features window frames with titlebar and buttons, configurable key
	bindings and mouse buttons, support for EWMH and motif hints,
	focus-follows-mouse and click-to-focus focus models, virtual desktops, Xft
	fonts and xinerama support.

  matwm2 only depends on Xlib and libc, and schould compile on almost any
  system that can run X11.
  It has been reported to work on FreeBSD, Linux, OpenBSD, DragonflyBSD,
  NetBSD, Interix and OpenSolaris (For FreeBSD and Linux it has been tested on
  both x86 and x86_64 architecture and it has also been reported to work on ppc
  Linux, all other operating systems were tested on x86. For x86_64 FreeBSD
  both the clang and gcc compiler have been tested, for x86 Linux both gcc and
  tcc have been tested, and for other platforms only gcc was tested yet).
  If you have succesfully compiled and ran matwm2 on another operating system
  (or with another compiler) or have problems getting matwm2 to work on your
  system let me know.
	
  The latest version can be found on http://matwm.fbsd.in/.
  Recent versions of matwm2 are distributed under the MIT licence, wich can be
  found in the LICENCE file that schould be included with your copy of matwm2.

INSTALLATION
  Considering that you found this file, we assumed you already aquired a copy of
  matwm2, and extracted the tarball.
  Typically the first step in installation will be to run (from whitin the
  directory containing the matwm2 source code - wich includes this file)
  "./configure", or "./configure --help" to see what options can be set for the
  configure script.
  This script will attempt to generate a Makefile suitable to compile and
  install matwm2 on your system, then summarize the information aquired to
  accomplish this - if you do not agree with these values, refer to the output
  of "./configure --help" for instructions on how to override them.
  The next step will be to run "make" wich will then attempt to compile matwm,
  and if all that went well you can then run "make install" (typically this has
  to be done as root, unless you are installing to a prefix whitin the user's
  home directory) to install matwm2.

For further information and before using matwm2, refer to the man page (run
"man matwm2" after install).
