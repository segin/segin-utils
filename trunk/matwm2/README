matwm2 is a simple window manager for X11. It features window frames with titlebar and buttons, configurable key bindings and mouse buttons, support for EWMH and motif hints, focus-follows-mouse and click-to-focus focus models and virtual desktops.
It is written and maintained by Mattis Michel <sic_zer0@hotmail.com>, and distributed under the MIT licence (see: LICENCE file).

To compile and install, review the paragraph the Makefile to specify the right folders to look for headers and libraries in and install to.
Also you may want to change some options for compiling (like wheter to include debugging symbols, or to compile without using xext), look in the second paragraph in the Makefile for changeing those.
After that run "make" and "make install" - if all goes well it schould then be compiled and installed.
Default built-in configuration is in default_matwmrc. Note that initialisation of most variables done in it is absolutely necessary for matwm2 to work propperly. After editing you schould run "make defcfg" to generate the code that will actually be compiled in.

Before usage and for further information, please consult the manual page (run "man matwm2" on a terminal, after it has been installed).
