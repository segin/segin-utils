destroynotify doesnt arrive in time whilst dragging windows sometimes i think - badwindow errors
also misterious badwindow errors occur - apearently this can be regenerated by closing amsn dialog boxes and some other windows
!iconified windows sometimes do not go to the right place when matwm gets signal 9 - do not reuse parent window?
if gvim starts (in some configurations) lower scrollbar is gone under window, also happens with some other wms and no wm - in fvwm it starts with same size but gvim updates itself, and in mwm it is mapped with the correct size for the scrollbar to apear (how is that done? does it include basesize in initial size?)
