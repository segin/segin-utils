destroynotify doesnt arrive in time whilst dragging windows sometimes i think - badwindow errors
also misterious badwindow errors occur - apearently this can be regenerated by closing amsn dialog boxes 
open mplayer go fullscreen go back and try resizing - .resize supposedly zero, for mplayer remaps its window and erm matwm has no way to update motif wm hints
