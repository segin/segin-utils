in some situations i can currently not reproduce, mplayer refuses to get key input
kicker stays in front of fullscreen windows in some situations
focus sometimes acts random

what if the window list becomes higher then the screen?
windows with same title are confusing
_NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL not fully supported
