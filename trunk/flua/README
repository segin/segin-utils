This was Lua 5.2.3, released on 11 Nov 2013.
Now it will be my attempt to make lua somewhat different.
I want arrays to start from 0. Add facilities for scope reduction, etc.
Maybe modify the syntax completely if practical.

For installation instructions, license details, and
further information about Lua, see doc/readme.html.
