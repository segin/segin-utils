Axel is a download "accelerator" that works by opening multiple connections 
to FTP and HTTP servers that support partial transfers. Axel also supports 
multiple connections across different servers for mirrored files. Axel is 
very lightweight and has no dependencies outside of that provided by any normal
POSIX-compliant OS.
