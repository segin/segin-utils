readbin - A small program for diagnosing executable headers

This program is a very simple one, you just give it the name of the program
file to examine. Sorry, but multiple files are NOT supported.

supports:
Linux a.out formats OMAGIC, QMAGIC, and ZMAGIC
ELF32
ELF64

It's pretty simple to add more formats.

Also, readbin.cs is an attempt (more like hello world) at a C#.NET version.
Use mcs to compile it with mono
