libc - some generic unfinished attempt at a libc, mostly a proof-of-concept.
============================================================================

Written in early 2010 by Kirn Gill <segin2005@gmail.com>

A barebones libc. So far, only has a few basic syscalls, and that's it.

Maybe I'll expand it. It's an old project I found on an old hard disk and 
decided to publish it's source for the humor and entertainment of others.
Maybe it'll provide me with something to do someday.

Not that there is much here, but it's licensed under the 
Internet Systems Consortium License, see the COPYING file.

NOTES
=====

libc will only run on FreeBSD.

Compile on Linux all you want, it'll just segfault.
