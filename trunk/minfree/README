Minfree is a small utility that keeps a defined amount of memory free on linux.
It works by checking memory usage repeatedly with a small interval, and if not
enough memory is available, it finds and kills whichever process is using most
memory.

Due security implications of this program I don't recommend running this on
mission critical systems. It's intend is to keep desktop systems running and
responsive when the browser decides to eat all memory.

Compiling and installation:
	Simply run "make" and a binary should present itself.
	"make install" should install the binary to /usr/bin.
	If not, contact me.

Running:
	You can run "minfree" without arguments and then it will kill when less
	than 64MB memory is free. Or you can tell amount of memory to keep free
	in kB as the first argument. And the second argument can be an interval
	in ms to tell it how often to check how much free memory we have.
