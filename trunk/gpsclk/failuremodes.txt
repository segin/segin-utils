startup screen remains on (and watchdog timer keeps resetting device every few seconds sending initialization data repeatedly)
	- UART commands do not reach receiever and cannot initialize receiver
	- GPS receiver board not wired propperly or broken
	- MCU GPIO broken
	- MCU clock failure
	- faulty power supply
	- corrupted ROM
	* normal operation should resume when fault resolved in < 30 seconds (watchdog reset + gps board starts)

	- check GPS receiver board and MCU power (5V, must be 4.9V and well regulated - any less and UT oncore board will not start)
	- check UART wiring between GPS receiver and MCU
	- check if GPS receiver is sending data (each second) to MCU
	- if not above one check if MCU tries to initialize receiver (every 10 seconds at least)
	- if one of the two above ones check rate of transmission (should be ~9600/9615 baud)
	- check if MCU xtal is oscillating at the proper frequency (20Mhz)
	- verify code memory of MCU

display shows "UART frame error" continuously
	- GPS receiver board disconnected or became unresponsive while unit running
	- MCU GPIO failure
	- MCU clock failure
	- faulty power supply
	- corrupted ROM
	* normal operation should resume when fault resolved in < 30 seconds (clear error + gps board starts)

	- check GPS receiver board and MCU power (5V, must be 4.9V and well regulated - any less and UT oncore board will not start)
	- check UART wiring between GPS receiver and MCU
	- check if GPS receiver is sending data (each second) to MCU
	- if not above one check if MCU tries to initialize receiver (every 10 seconds at least)
	- if one of the two above ones check rate of transmission (should be ~9600/9615 baud)
	- verify code memory of MCU

display shows "MCU clock failed"
	- faulty xtal oscillator
	- faulty capacitors for xtal
	- faulty power supply
	- broken MCU
	- corrupted ROM
	* normal operation should resume when fault resolved in < 30 seconds (watchdog timer reset)

	- check if MCU power properly regulated (must be > 4.5V for xtal to start)
	- check xtal and associated capacitors

display shows "ROM checksum bad"
	- ROM data corrupted
	- firmware no good
	- MCU broken

	- verify firmware was assembled with the correct checksum in it
	- rewrite the ROM and check again
	- replace MCU

display backlight off and shows nothing at all (yet other things do work)
	- display not properly connected
	- display broken
	- display backlight broken
	* normal operation should resume in one or two seconds if displaying time and all else ok (display reset sent)
	* otherwise < 30 seconds startup screen should be shown

	- verify display has backlight power
	- verify display backlight is working

display backlight on but shows garbage or nothing at all
	- contrast setting out of bounds
	- contrast setting potmeter broken
	- display improperly wired
	- display broken
	- MCU or its GPIO broken
	- faulty power supply
	* normal operation should resume in one or two seconds if displaying time and all else ok (display reset sent)
	* otherwise < 30 seconds startup screen should be shown

	- verify contrast setting and if potmeter and its wiring is ok
	- verify power supply regulation
	- verify display connection and signals
	- verify display is working and contrast setting good

nothing happens at all
	- power supply broken
